# Swift.Geometry

Swift.Geometry consists of several 2D/3D geometric contructs built using platform independent* Swift and are intended to assist in the development of 2D & 3D games or systems.

*To avoid platform dependant code, some mathematical functions such as `sqrtf()` have been implemented in this package.

Currently implemented:
- Vector2
- Vector3
- Quaternion
